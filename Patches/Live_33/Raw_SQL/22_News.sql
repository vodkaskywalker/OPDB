'Syndicate Directive: Recover Lost Technologies',
'To: All Syndicate Agents


Agents,


The Syndicate urgently requires your assistance in securing vital lost technologies.

Our secret scientific laboratory on Daoden was pivotal in studying the Niani Cultists and their advanced command protocols, used to control and empower their followers. By partially deciphering these protocols, Syndicate researchers successfully developed a prototype system for drone commands.

Unfortunately, the Niani Cultists discovered the laboratory, launching an invasion that compromised the facility. While Syndicate forces managed to salvage basic versions of these commands, it is believed that improved command protocols and additional technologies remain hidden on Daoden.

Your mission is critical:

    Investigate Network Breaches on Hershfield by performing artifact scans.
    Eliminate the Gatekeeper to gain access to Daoden.
    Recover improved protocols and any other valuable technologies.

Time is of the essence. The Syndicate relies on your skills and determination to reclaim what has been lost.


For the Syndicate,

Command Directorate',
