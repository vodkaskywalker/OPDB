'To: All Syndicate Agents


Agents,


We are facing a critical situation that requires your immediate attention and expertise.

As you know, the island of Daoden vanished from the Nia teleport network several years ago, cutting off all contact and energy flow. Until recently, it had remained lost, with no explanation. However, Daoden has reappeared. Strangely, it is not connected to the teleport network, raising significant concerns about what might be happening on the island.

Simultaneously, our teleportation infrastructure on Herschfield has been breached. Initial investigations suggest that these breaches could serve as a pathway to Daoden. To complicate matters further, a group of Niani, known as the Niani Cultists, have become increasingly aggressive, invading several key islands. Their intentions remain unclear, but we suspect they may be involved in Daoden''s return.

We have dispatched scouting teams to Daoden to assess the situation and attempt to regain control, but their progress has been slow, and intelligence is limited. We need your help.


Your Mission:

- Deploy immediately to Herschfield and investigate the breaches in the teleport network.

- Secure access to Daoden and report on any anomalies you encounter.

- Assist in re-establishing Syndicate control over Daoden and ensure the stability of the energy flow.

- Be on high alert for any interaction with the Niani Cultists. Approach with cautionâ€”they may be more dangerous than we currently understand.


This mission is of the utmost priority. Daoden holds critical resources that the Syndicate cannot afford to lose. Your skills, determination, and commitment are crucial to the success of this operation.


Prepare for immediate departure.


For the Syndicate,

Command Directorate',
